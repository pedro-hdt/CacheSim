/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 *  NOTE ON IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:
 * 
 *  To keep track of the block that was first written in memory and the block
 *  that was least recently used, I have decided to just use the access_number
 *  as a timestamp. This will work correclty, AS LONG AS THE NUMBER OF ACCESSES
 *  IS <= UINTMAX_T. Beyond that point, I am aware that this kind of 
 *  implementation MIGHT break, due to overflow.
 *  However, in most modern systems (64bit), this will mean that it might break
 *  when the number of accesses is larger than 2^64 = 1.8e19. This seems like
 *  a perfectly reasonable constraint to work with. Besides, it is also
 *  that it actually breaks.
 *  Of course: in the real world, the cache operates continuously, so this
 *  would not be feasible, but for the purpose of this simulator, I consider
 *  it to be.
 *  
 *  Alternatively, one could create a queue data structure and do as follows:
 *  For FIFO:
 *      -> everytime a new block is written to (ie. tag is replaced), we would
 *         push that block to the queue (append it to the end)
 *      -> for every replacement, pop the block that is the head of the queue,
 *         which will be the oldest, and replace it
 *  For LRU, the difference would be that on a hit, we would remove the hit
 *  block from the queue (regardless of its position), and push it to the end
 *  again.
